                                In order to find a dataset, we first had to settle on a topic. We wanted to take this opportunity to draw attention to a social justice issue of interest. This led us to a discussion of food insecurity in the United states, a problem that is rampant despite the US’s level of development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We obtained data from Feeding America on the state of food insecurity in the United States from 2009-2018. Feeding America is an organization focused on addressing the hunger crisis in the U.S. via a national network of foodbanks. This data provided food insecurity rates by state, the number of food insecure individuals, childhood poverty and food insecurity, among other elements. We chose to take an exploratory approach, evaluating the state of food insecurity in the US and investigating how it has changed over time by state.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From here, we needed to do some processing in order to translate our data into a useful form for our visualizations. For different visualizations we made different CSV files that had the data in different forms: averages, totals, specific trends over time, etc. We also collected geo-json data in order to create maps with our data. Once the data was clean and usable, we were able to start creating initial prototypes. As we narrowed down our project’s focus, we did additional data cleaning, such as converting the childhood poverty rate that was initially reported from its form at 185% of the actual poverty line, down to the correct values at the poverty line. This data cleaning made our visualizations possible!

                        <b>Design Process</b>
                        <div style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"> 
                            <p>
                                The design process followed the general outline set by the final project deadlines: sketching, prototyping, collecting user feedback, and further refinement into the current form. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our project evolved heavily from the initial sketching to its current form. At the beginning of our project, we lacked a central theme, making our visualizations generally less effective. We first had to establish what our central theme would be: an exploration of food insecurity by state, and how it has changed over time, with the goal of drawing attention to the problem. We ended up dropping one entire visualization and significantly changing others. For example, the visualization in section one was initially a symbol map next to a choropleth map, with minimal interactivity. However, after refinement and feedback, we ultimately dropped the symbol map (as it did not add much meaning because absolute levels followed population distribution), moved the first choropleth map to the next section, and added more interactivity and space for comparisons. This improvement, among others, was essential in consolidating our project into telling one, clear story. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The user feedback study was paramount in the development of our final product. In order to make our story more clear, the user feedback prompted us to shift the first ‘comparisons’ visualization from a crowded, multi-vis format, to a more clear, transition format. This shift in vision has undoubtedly allowed that visualization to be more powerful and enlightening. Additionally, the feedback on the small details that needed cleaning up was very invaluable. This took the form of making color schemes clearer, formatting numbers better, and making the user interactions more obvious. These improvements were also key in progressing to our current product.

                                            <b>Additional interactivity</b> - We would like to increase the level of interactivity in future improvements. We have interactivity in dragging and transitions in our first visualization, and in the remaining ones, we leverage tooltips, highlighting, and altered opacity to improve user experience. We would like to link more visualizations in the future - for example, creating on-demand graphs of changes in food security over time based on certain states.

                                            <b>More detailed data</b> - We would like to be able to tell even more specific stories about food insecurity in the future. For example, incorporating data relating to policies surrounding food insecurity could be a good way to explain why certain states and areas do better than others. Also, getting more time series data would allow us to tell more about trends over time in the US. Getting county level data would allow us to look more deeply at the specific location of high levels of insecurity, for example, whether it affects urban or rural areas more.

                                            Food insecurity in the US is improving, but it is still an uphill battle. This exploratory analysis is only the tip of the iceberg of disadvantaged populations in the US. For a country that is so advanced and developed in other ways, the US has a long way to go in making sure that its population is fed and healthy.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Though on the whole food insecurity is improving in the US, states experience this problem very differently. We saw rates ranging from 20% to 8%, indicating that some states are tackling this problem much more effectively than others. Aligning with our future improvement of incorporating policy data, we think that investigating why some states are addressing this crisis so poorly is critical.
                                        </p>

                                            Telling one, clear story through data and visualization is not easy. It takes a lot of careful data selection and processing, design, and refinement. We were surprised by how much time we spent crafting our story; we are accustomed to spending the overwhelming majority of our time focusing on development, but visualization requires that we craft a complete, focused vision before any meaningful development can begin. Our story still has more to it and could be clarified even more, but we believe that this is a good start.
