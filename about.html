                                In order to find a dataset, we first had to settle on a topic. We wanted to take this opportunity to draw attention to a social justice issue of interest. This led us to a discussion of food insecurity in the United states, a problem that is rampant despite the US’s level of development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We obtained data from Feeding America on the state of food insecurity in the United States from 2009-2018. Feeding America is an organization focused on addressing the hunger crisis in the U.S. via a national network of foodbanks. This data provided food insecurity rates by state, the number of food insecure individuals, childhood poverty and food insecurity, among other elements. We chose to take an exploratory approach, evaluating the state of food insecurity in the US and investigating how it has changed over time by state.

                                From here, we needed to do some processing in order to translate our data into a useful form for our visualizations. For different visualizations we made different CSV files that had the data in different forms: averages, totals, specific trends over time, etc. We also collected geo-json data in order to create maps with our data. Once the data was clean and usable, we were able to start creating initial prototypes. As we narrowed down our project’s focus, we did additional data cleaning, such as converting the childhood poverty rate that was initially reported from its form at 185% of the actual poverty line, down to the correct values at the poverty line. This data cleaning made our visualizations possible!
