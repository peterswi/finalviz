                One may assume the levels of child poverty would correlate with child food insecurity. But as you look at the two maps below, you may notice that where the poverty rate is high in some states, levels of food insecurity are relatively low and vice versa. These inconsistencies in the maps draw attention to the ways that different states handle the issue of food insecurity.

                    Section 3:  Now let's look at where food insecurity is really the worst, and how it's changing.
                    <br> <br>
                    Overall, food insecurity is largely improving across the country - residents were generally more food
                    secure in 2018 than they were in 2009. Check out the following visualization to explore the direction of
                    changes in all 50 states, and see where food insecurity is becoming more dire.
                    <br> <br>
                     The red and green lines indicate how much food insecrutiy rates have changed in a given state from 2009
                        to 2018. The longer the line, the greater the change. The color indicates if the given state's population
                        has become <span style="color:red">more food insecure over time </span> or <span style="color:green">less food insecure over time</span>. Mouse over each line for more information.

                        </br></br>
                        We've already shown that there is a general downwards trend in food insecurity nationwide, but what could be affecting this? Unemployment is a publicly available data asset that is often telling when it comes to looking at poverty, and so here we compare the trend of food insecurity to that of unemployment.
                        </br></br>
                        In this section we have two charts, the first being an area chart highlighting the change in food insecurity rates in every state over time, and the second being a bar chart highlighting changing unemployment rates over time. We can see that both of these charts have the same downward trend, indicating there is a correlation between unemployment rate and food insecurity rate. The food insecurity rate chart is interactive, try drawing a box over a certain time period to see the unemployment rate at that time.
